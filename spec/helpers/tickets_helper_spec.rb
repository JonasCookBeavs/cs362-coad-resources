# Specs in this file have access to a helper object that includes

#
# describe TIcketsHelper do
#   describe "string concat" do
#     it "concats two strings with spaces" do
#       expect(helper.concat_strings("this","that")).to eq("this that")
#     end
#   end
# end
RSpec.describe TicketsHelper, type: :helper do
# try a ton of phone numbers in different formats and see if they get normalized
# if need be try putting a puts in tickets_helper to see the format it returns
end
